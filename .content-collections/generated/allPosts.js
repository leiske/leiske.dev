I use neovim (btw) so two conflicting editors, really disjoint experiences felt clunky to me.\n\nWith opencode living in a tmux (btw) pane, I feel it integrates much more cleanly into my workflows. \n\n## Agents\n\nI haven't tried out plugins like oh-my-opencode or Ralph Wiggins or whatever other fancy things live out there yet.\n\nI'll probably just start with running this thing in a while loop and updating a markdown file as memory - but for now I've done well with just an opencode session or two.\n\n\n## Usage in large scale projects\n\nI can't use opencode at work, but hopefully I can get my hands on claude code soon to get a comparable terminal based experience.\nGoing back to work from PTO on Monday will feel like a jump back in time to be frank. Cursor is great, but so far opencode matches my style (or atleast the terminal tooling).",
