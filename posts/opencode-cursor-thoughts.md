# AI aided development

I've been trying out the AI tools for about maybe two years now, starting with Copilot in the early days and then onto Cursor and now giving [opencode](https://opencode.ai/) a real spin over the holidays.

The jump from early Cursor to these days Cursor with plan mode, better models, etc was quite big for me at work.

But the jump to opencode has felt great in the past two weeks. 

## Terminal tooling

I know Cursor has it's own terminal based tooling now, but I haven't given it a fair shot yet.

That being said, I never liked using an IDE just to get the AI tooling.
I use neovim (btw) so two conflicting editors, basically two really disjoint experiences felt clunky to me.

With opencode living in a tmux (btw) pane, I feel it integrates much more cleanly into my workflows. 

## Agents

I haven't tried out plugins like oh-my-opencode or Ralph Wiggins or whatever other fancy things live out there yet.

I'll probably just start with running this thing in a while loop and updating a markdown file as memory - but for now I've done well with just an opencode session or two.


## Usage in large scale projects

I can't use opencode at work, but hopefully I can get my hands on claude code soon to get a comparable terminal based experience.
Going back to work from PTO on Monday will feel like a jump back in time to be frank. Cursor is great, but so far opencode matches my style (or atleast the terminal tooling).
