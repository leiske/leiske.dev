# Markdown Rendering Test

This is the third test post to verify various markdown features and reading time calculations.

## Testing Headings

This post includes multiple heading levels to test the markdown renderer properly handles them.

### Code Blocks

Let's test code blocks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  return true;
}
```

### Lists

Unordered list:
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

Ordered list:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Testing Formatting

**Bold text** and *italic text* and ***bold italic***.

## Inline Code

This is inline `code` within text.

## Links and References

You can create links like [this](https://example.com) to external resources.

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.

## Reading Time Verification

This post is intentionally longer than the previous test posts. With approximately 200 words per minute as the reading speed assumption, this post should show a reading time of around 2-3 minutes.

The purpose is to ensure that:
1. Word counting works correctly
2. Reading time calculation is accurate
3. The display format shows minutes appropriately

## Conclusion

This post demonstrates various markdown features including code blocks, lists, formatting, blockquotes, and more. If everything renders correctly, the markdown parsing is working as expected.
